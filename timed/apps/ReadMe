Release code for ring-diagram analysis in the HMI pipeline

If this directory is part of the CVS tree, the files in this directory have
been mirrored from a specific version control system outside CVS and should
not be modified without the consent of the author, Rick Bogart. Any changes
introduced that are not synchronized with changes to the original control
files are likely to be lost.

	Modules
datavg.c	produce mean and variance matrices of selected data
gentargs.c	generate appropriate target lists of latitudes and longitudes
		for various analysis series appropriate for selected time
maicalc.c	integrate values from tracked magnetograms to get
		appropriate Magnetic Activity Index
mtrack.c	map and track multiple regions from a time sequence of solar
		images into a set of xyt data cubes
pspec3.c	calculate 3-d power spectra of xyt data cubes
rdcover.c	report coverage for selected input for mtrack
rdfitc.c	fit 3-d region spectra (ring-diagrams) using method of
		Basu and Antia
rdfitf.c	fit 3-d region spectra (ring-diagrams) using method of Haber
		N.B. There is currently no rule to make this module, nor
		supporting code; it is included for reference only
rdsinv.c	asymptotic inversion of ring fits for thermal structure
		parameters as functions of depth
rdvinv.c	OLA inversion of ring fits for velocity parameters as functions
		of depth
