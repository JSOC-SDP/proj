 TOTAL_BAD_VCDU=    |Total number of zero-filled VCDUs in TLM file. They|
                    |may correspond to missing VCDUs (discontinuity in  |

(1) Repeat pair as necessary for each gap in the VCDU sequence number

This .dsf contains the file names of all the telemetry files that the DDS
has that have not yet been acknowledged or have not yet been retransmission 
requested by the SOC.

The dsf file will contain ASCII text entries as follow:
 Keyword            |Description                                      |
 FILE_NAME=         |Name of TLM file (present in DDS and Not         |
                    |acknowledged or Not rexmit request by SOC)       |
 FILE_SIZE=         |Size in bytes of TLM file.                       |
 STATUS=            |Status of TLM file (see below)                   |

At the end of each day the SOC will write a .ack file to /soc2dds
containing the tlm file names that have been archived successfully on
that day.
The .ack file will contain ASCII text entries as follows:
 Keyword            |Description                                      |

 FILE_SIZE=         |Size in bytes of TLM file.                       |
 STATUS=            |4= Archived is the only valid value in the ACK   |
                    |file                                             |
