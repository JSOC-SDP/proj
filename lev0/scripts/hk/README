README:
(1)On Creating LATEST HKPDF, PRELIMINARY JSD, JSOC MAP, and FINAL JSD FILES.
These example steps below to explain a process used to deliver the latest 
set of files for ticket 105. 

***Some warnings ***
This process used the HKPDF files in /home/carl/cvs/TBL_JSOC/lev0/hk_config_file and
/home/carl/cvs/TBL_JSOC/lev0/sdo_hk_config_file. It is important to have all files there
from 1.32 to 1.163 for hmi and 1.1 to 1.3 for sdo to correctly create preliminary jsd files.
This process used the preliminary files at /home/carl/cvs/TBL_JSOC/lev0/hk_prelim_jsd_file/prod. 
Its important to have all prelim jsd files there to create correct jsoc map files.
The map files used were located at /home/carl/cvs/TBL_JSOC/lev0/hk_jsn_map_file/prod to
help create the final jsd files. It is important the map files are updated to create the latest
final jsd files. Finally the final jsd files are used to create our HK BY APID data series. 
If creating series for production, login as production.

**Steps**
First created HKPDF files using make_hkpdf.pl script. Do this by doing step 1 and 2.
-1-->Copied STANFORD_TLM_HMI_AIA.txt file version 1.160 to directory /home3/carl/cvs/TBL_JSOC/lev0/fromlmsal/
-2-->Ran: % make_hkpdf.pl sort=4 apidlist="ALL_HK"
Second create the  preliminary jsd files following steps 3 and 4.
-3-->Ran  % jsoc _make_jsd_file.pl prelim  1.160 HK
-4-->Repeat step 1 to 4 for 1.161,1.162 and 1.163.
Third create the jsoc version map files following steps 5.
-5-->Ran: % jsoc_do_jsvn_map_file.pl -g 1.1.163 HK 
Fourth create the final jsd  files following steps 6 and 7.
-6-->Ran: % jsoc _make_jsd_file.pl final  1.160 HK
-7-->Ran: % Repeat step 6 for 1.161,1.162 and 1.163.
Fifth, create hmi and aia data series step 8. Login as production(su production) if creating for production.
-8-->Ran: % create_series <new final jsd files create in steps 7 and 8>
Sixth, Follow similar process done for hmi and aia packets for sdo. Create SDO HKPDF files step 9 and 10.
-9-->Copied GODDARD_TLM_SDO.txt file version 1.1 to directory /home3/carl/cvs/TBL_JSOC/lev0/fromgoddard/
-10->Ran: % make_hkpdf.pl sort=4 apidlist="ALL_SDO"
Seventh, create the  preliminary jsd files following steps 11 and 12.
-11->Ran  % jsoc _make_jsd_file.pl prelim  1.1 SDO
-12->Repeat step 1 to 4 for 1.2 and 1.3.
 Eight, create the jsoc version map files following steps 13.
-13-->Ran: % jsoc_do_jsvn_map_file.pl -g 1.3 SDO
Ninth, create the final jsd  files following steps 14 and 15.
-14->Ran: % jsoc _make_jsd_file.pl final  1.1 SDO
-15->Ran: % Repeat step 7 for 1.2 and 1.3.
Tenth, create sdo data series step 16. Login as production(su production) if creating for production.
-16->Ran: % create_series <new final sdo jsd files create in steps 14 and 15>
