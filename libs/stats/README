Statistics functions, core routines from Keh-Cheng Chu.
DRMS utility functions added to add statistics using standard
keyword names to a record associated with a segment that has an associated array.

The fstats/fstats2 and dstats/dstats2 pairs differ only in the way
the median is computed.  In the fstats,dstats cases the data array
is sorted and the value at midpoint is returned as the median.
In fthe dstats/dstats2 cases a historgram of 64K values is computed
and the median is estimated by the bin where the cumlative number of
values is half the total.

fstats operates on float arrays, dstats on doubles.

In both cases the calcs are done as doubles.

Return values mean:
#define OK 0
#define OUT_OF_MEMORY -1
#define TOO_FEW_GOOD_POINTS -2
