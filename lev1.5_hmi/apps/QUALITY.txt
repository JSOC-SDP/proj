Here is the current meaning of the QUALITY keyword for the line-of-sight observables:

//NO OBSERVABLES PRODUCED AND THE REASON WHY
QUAL_NODATA                  (0x80000000)  //no l.o.s. observables image was produced (empty record created, with NO DATA SEGMENT. Most keywords have default value)
QUAL_TARGETFILTERGRAMMISSING (0x40000000)  //no target filtergram was found near target time (target filtergram=filtergram used to identify the framelist): due either to missing filtergrams or because no observable sequence was run
QUAL_NOINTERPOLATEDKEYWORDS  (0x20000000)  //could not interpolate some keywords at target time (CROTA2, DSUN_OBS, and CRLT_OBS are required by do_interpolate()), because several lev 1 records are missing/corrupted
QUAL_NOFRAMELISTINFO         (0x10000000)  //could not figure out which observables framelist was used, or the framelist run for the required time range is not an observables framelist
QUAL_WRONGCADENCE            (0x08000000)  //the cadence corresponding to the framelist run at the required time does not match the expected value provided by user (error from user, or issue with the framelist)
QUAL_WRONGTARGET             (0x04000000)  //the target filtergram does not belong to the current framelist (something is wrong either with the framelist or the target filtergram)
QUAL_MISSINGLEV1D            (0x02000000)  //not enough lev1d filtergrams to produce an observable (too many lev 1 records were missing or corrupted)
QUAL_MISSINGKEYWORDLEV1D     (0x01000000)  //could not read some needed keywords (like FID) in the lev1d data (too many lev 1 records were missing or corrupted and the corresponding lev 1d record is unusable)
QUAL_WRONGWAVELENGTHNUM      (0x00800000)  //the number of wavelengths in the lev1d records is not correct (issue with the framelist, or too many lev 1 records were missing or corrupted)
QUAL_MISSINGKEYWORDLEV1P     (0x00400000)  //could not read some needed keywords in the lev1p data (too many lev 1 records were missing or corrupted and the corresponding lev 1p record is unusable)
QUAL_NOLOOKUPRECORD          (0x00200000)  //could not find a record for the look-up tables for the MDI-like algorithm (the MDI-like algorithm could not be applied)
QUAL_NOLOOKUPKEYWORD         (0x00100000)  //could not read the keywords of the look-up tables for the MDI-like algorithm (the MDI-like algorithm could not be applied)

QUAL_INTERPOLATIONFAILED     (0x00040000)  //the temporal interpolation routine failed (no lev1d record was produced)

QUAL_NOCOEFFKEYWORD          (0x00000200)  //could not read the keywords of the polynomial coefficient series for the correction of the MDI-like algorithm
QUAL_NOCOEFFPRECORD          (0x00000080)  //could not find a record for the polynomial coefficient for the correction of the MDI-like algorithm, or could not access the keywords of a specific record

//OBSERVABLES CREATED BUT IN SUB-OPTIMAL CONDITIONS
QUAL_LOWINTERPNUM            (0x00010000)  //the number of interpolation points (for temporal interpolation) was not always as high as expected, AND/OR 2 interpolation points were separated by more than the cadence
QUAL_LOWKEYWORDNUM           (0x00008000)  //some keywords (especially CROTA2, DSUN_OBS, and CRLT_OBS) could not be interpolated properly at target time, but a closest-neighbour approximation was used
QUAL_ISSTARGET               (0x00004000)  //the ISS loop was OPEN for one or several filtergrams used to produce the observable
QUAL_NOTEMP                  (0x00002000)  //cannot read the temperatures needed for polarization calibration (default temperature used)
QUAL_NOGAPFILL               (0x00001000)  //the code could not properly gap-fill all the lev 1 filtergrams
QUAL_LIMBFITISSUE            (0x00000800)  //some lev1 records were discarded because R_SUN, and/or CRPIX1/CRPIX2 were missing or were too different from the median value of the other lev1 records (too much jitter for instance)
QUAL_NOCOSMICRAY             (0x00000400)  //some cosmic-ray hit lists could not be read for the level 1 filtergrams
QUAL_ECLIPSE                 (0x00000100)  //at least one lev1 record was taken during an eclipse
QUAL_LARGEFTSID              (0x00000040)  //HFTSACID of target filtergram > 4000, which adds noise to observables
QUAL_POORQUALITY             (0x20)        //poor quality: careful when using these observables due to eclipse, or lunar transit, or thermal recovery, or open ISS, or other issues...

//SOME (OR ALL) IQUV DATA SEGMENTS WERE NOT PRODUCED AND THE REASON WHY
