This directory contains a "cookbook" collection of sample DRMS modules,
along with a simplified make system that can be used to build comparable
applications modules outside of the NetDRMS/JSOC distribution trees.

Recipe 0: How to write and build a minimal DRMS module

The program smpl_00.c shows the minimum structure necessary for a C program
that will be able to interact with the DRMS API to fetch and store date in
the DRMS and SUMS. This module in fact does neither; but it nevertheless
opens the required connection to the DRMS, and will fail if that is not
possible for some reason, such as the database server being unavailable or
the user lacking proper authorization to access it. It can therefore serve
as a useful test for minimal connectivity to DRMS.

The module can be built, like all modules in this directory, by typing

      make smpl_00

(alternatively, you can simply type make and all the modules in the target
list MODS in Makefile will be compiled.) The Makefile is generic: it is
designed to work on different hardware and operating system platforms by
accessing an appropriate set of make variables definitions from the various
files in the subdirectory makevars. To add a new module that does not require
linking with any additional libraries beyond those required for DRMS, all you
need to do (besides writing the module!) is to append its name (without the
filename extension) to the list of MODS in the Makefile.

Note that the Makefile requires the external definition of the environment
variable JPLAT to the appropriate name for your build platform. If when you
run the make you get a message like:

Error: no appropriate Makevars; is $JPLAT defined? won't compile...

Either you have not defined the system-appropriate environment variable,
or there is no file Makevars_$JPLAT.mk in the Makevars directory. It should
be straightforward to create an appropriate one by replicating one of the
existing examples and substituting appropriate command paths.

The Makefile also requires external definition of the environment variable
$DRMS to be the root of your NetDRMS distribution as described in the
installation instructions. If you get an error message like:

error: could not open source file "jsoc_main.h"

it is probably because you have not correctly set the DRMS environment variable.
