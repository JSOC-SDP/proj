along with a simplified make system that can be used to build comparable
applications modules outside of the NetDRMS/JSOC distribution trees.

smpl_01.c	echoes its arguments, of a wide variety of types
smpl_02.c	prints a list of the data series known to DRMS - a simple

	and the number of data segments per record - a simple version of
	show_info
