These libraries are used by mex2c as well as mex-from-matlab.

libmexrng.a    -- random number generation (not to do with mex at all)
libmatrix_io.a -- input/output of matrices as strings, nan generation
                  used by non-mex numerical routines
libmextools.a  -- useful stuff for mexfiles incl. mexfile argument checking

Only the last really depends on matlab's mex environment.
