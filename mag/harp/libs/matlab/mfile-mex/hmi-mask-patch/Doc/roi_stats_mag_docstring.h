	" * A set of per-region statistics is gathered based on regions\n"
	" encoded in the image inputs x (containing region tags, 1..Nr, or\n"
	" 0 for no tag) and y (containing region indicators, 0/1).  The\n"
	" statistics are functions of region configuration, and of\n"
	" line-of-sight magnetic field mag.\n"
	" * x must be NaN, or a nonnegative integer.  Pixels in the\n"
	" range 1..Nr, where Nr is the number of regions, are treated as\n"
	" tags for being within the named region.\n"
	" Inputs x of 0 or NaN are treated as not belonging to any\n"
	" labeled region.\n"
	" * y that is finite and nonzero (e.g., 1) indicates activity present.\n"
	" Not all tagged pixels will be active; typically the tagged pixels\n"
	" are large blobs, and the active pixels are finer details within\n"
	" each blob.\n"
	" * For each region, a row of statistics is computed:\n"
	"    1: rgnnum = # pixels tagged (all may not be active)\n"
	"    2: rgnsize = projected (flat) area in microhemispheres (0..1e6)\n"
	"    3: rgnarea = un-projected (solid-angle) area in microhemispheres (0..1e6)\n"
	"    4: arnum = # active pixels (x == 1)\n"
	"    5: arsize = projected (flat) active area in microhemispheres (0..1e6)\n"
	"    6: ararea = unprojected (solid-angle) active area in microhemis (0..1e6)\n"
	"    7: arlat,lon = average location, weighted by un-projected area\n"
	"    9: arminlat,lon  lower corner of (lat,lon) bounding box\n"
	"   11: armaxlat,lon  upper corner of (lat,lon) bounding box\n"
	"   13: rgnbtot = sum of absolute LoS flux within the identified region\n"
	"   14: rgnbnet = net LoS flux within the identified region\n"
	"   15: rgnbpos = absolute value of total positive LoS flux\n"
	"   16: rgnbneg = absolute value of total negative LoS flux\n"
	"   17: arfwtlat,lon = flux-weighted center of active pixels\n"
	"   19: arfwtpos_lat,lon = flux-weighted center of positive flux\n"
	"   21: arfwtneg_lat,lon = flux-weighted center of negative flux\n"
	"   23: daysgone = #days until bounding box vanishes from front of disk\n"
	"   24: daysback = #days until bounding box first reappears on front\n"
	" These definitions are in a machine-readable include file,\n"
