	" * array is a d-dimensional real-valued array; it is written in\n"
	" natural Matlab/Fortran order to filename.  (The transposed\n"
	" version is just \"savefits\".)\n"
	" * filename is silently overwritten if it exists.\n"
	" * bitpix must belong to {8,16,32,64,-32,-64}; negative numbers imply\n"
	" floating-point FITS output, 8 is *unsigned* character, and 16, 32,\n"
	" 64 are signed integers.\n"
	" * bscale and bzero are most useful when integers are written.\n"
	" Whenever they are supplied, the value actually written to the file,\n"
	" which must belong to the corresponding range, is:\n"
	"    (array - bzero) / bscale\n"
	" Therefore, unsigned integers may be written using bscale = 1\n"
	" and bzero = 2^15, 2^31, etc.\n"
	" * blank is the value of the blank flag to be used in the FITS file.\n"
	" A blank will be inserted when an IEEE NaN is encountered in\n"
	" the image input.  This will be turned back into a NaN by a FITS\n"
	" reader.\n"
	" * If the blank is supplied as zero, a standard default is used:\n"
	" bitpix=8 --> blank = 255; 16 --> -32768; 32 --> -2^31; 64 -> -2^52.\n"
	" (The last is the largest double-precision integer.)  This\n"
	" practice is recommended.\n"
	" * If the matrix contains NaNs, and bitpix belongs to {8,16,32,64},\n"
	" the blank argument must be given.  In this case, there\n"
	" could be a conflict between of the legitimate integer codings\n"
	" and its use as a blank flag.  Of course, whatever value of blank\n"
	" is used, the image must not contain any value such that\n"
	" (array - bzero)/bscale == blank, or it too will be interpreted\n"
	" as a NaN.\n"
	" * Note that the blank argument is the value put into the FITS\n"
	" file, not in the original image.  It is not translated using\n"
	" bscale and bzero.\n"
	" * Error is 1 if there was an error, 0 otherwise.  An error\n"
	" synopsis is printed if error = 1.\n"
