	" [y,s,post,nclean]=hmi_segment(xm,xp,edge,iter,T,beta,alpha,geom,rho,m1,...)\n"
	" * Integrated routine for deriving HMI segmentations.  Uses\n"
	" models (m1,m2,...), plus a magnetogram-photogram pair (xm,xp),\n"
	" to deduce an integer labeling.  Besides images and models,\n"
	" it also requires some disk parameters and labeling smoothness\n"
	" parameters.\n"
	" * The defaults for iter and T are inherited from mrf_segment_wts,\n"
	" and should be looked up there.\n"
	" * The posterior probability `post' of the mrf fit can be returned;\n"
	" this can quickly verify repeatability.\n"
	" * The extreme limb can be a problem for labeling; `edge' helps with\n"
	" this.  We set the last edge(1) pixels to the value edge(2), and\n"
	" return the number of such pixels modified, optionally, in nclean.\n"
	" Typically edge=[3 1]; both can be real-valued.\n"
